Dfex (pronounced 'defects'):
    An experimental digital effects pedal.

Goal:
    To create unique effects only plausible digitally. 

    Analog effects are cool and digital implementations of them usually sound 
    poor.  Dfex aims to embrace the digital workspace as a new frontier of 
    effect design.
