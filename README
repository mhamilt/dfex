Dfex (pronounced 'defects'):
    An experimental digital audio effects pedal.

Goal:
    To create unique effects only plausible digitally. 

    Analog effects are cool but creating digital copycats doesn't progress the
    field. Dfex aims to embrace the digital workspace as a frontier of new 
    audio effect design.
